# ScreenOff

A small native MacBook app that disables the built-in display while you use an external monitor. Built with Swift, SwiftUI and AppKit, with no third-party dependencies.

**[Download for Mac](https://github.com/GevorgSogomonian/ScreenOff/releases/latest)** · [Report an issue](https://github.com/GevorgSogomonian/ScreenOff/issues/new/choose) · [Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)

**Apple Silicon (M1 or later), macOS 13+.** Download the DMG from the latest release's Assets section. The app is ad-hoc signed and is not notarized by Apple; installation instructions are below.

The main switch is **“Use built-in display” with an external monitor**.

- **On:** use both displays.
- **Off:** automatically disable the MacBook display when an external monitor is connected, and restore it when the cable is disconnected.

ScreenOff runs **without a menu bar or Dock icon**. Press **⌘Space**, type **ScreenOff** and press Return to open settings. Closing the window leaves the app running in the background. Your display preference is saved.

The power button in the window quits ScreenOff and restores the built-in display.

## Installation

1. Download `ScreenOff-1.3.2-arm64.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/GevorgSogomonian/ScreenOff/releases/latest). When updating, first quit the old ScreenOff using the power button in its window.
2. Drag **ScreenOff.app → Applications** and replace the previous app if prompted.
3. Open ScreenOff to see its settings. Use Spotlight or Applications in Finder to reopen the window later.

The release targets **Apple Silicon, macOS 13+**. Ordinary display disabling needs no administrator privileges, Accessibility permission or Screen Recording permission. The optional Night Shift exclusion requests administrator approval when applying or restoring a display override. No system drivers are installed.

The app is **ad-hoc signed**, without an Apple Developer certificate or notarization. If Gatekeeper blocks the downloaded app, first attempt to open it, then use **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**. Do not disable Gatekeeper or SIP.

## Behavior

- Switching to another application automatically hides the ScreenOff window, including when changing Stage Manager groups. This also applies outside Stage Manager. Display control continues in the background; reopening ScreenOff through Spotlight brings settings back. This is automatic window dismissal, rather than ordinary Stage Manager group membership.
- The display is disabled in WindowServer's display configuration and removed from the active desktop. Brightness and gamma are unchanged; ScreenOff does not cover the panel with a black window.
- ScreenOff does not disable the last usable display. Disconnecting the last active external monitor restores the built-in display.
- The switch saves your preference for external-monitor use. You can set it before connecting a monitor. Turning it on restores the built-in display immediately; turning it off disables the display when a suitable external monitor is connected.
- Locking the Mac keeps an already disabled built-in screen off while the same user owns the console and the external monitor is available. A completed disable is also preserved through display/system sleep; no display transactions run while asleep. Closing the lid or losing console ownership requests recovery, which waits for an open lid and awake displays. Disconnecting the external still restores the built-in screen, including on the lock screen.
- After wake, ScreenOff keeps the existing disable if macOS preserved it. If macOS reactivates the panel, the independent helper can reapply disabling while the same user’s console is locked, after checking the protected external monitor. This cannot guarantee that macOS never lights the panel briefly. A switched-out or unknown console cannot authorize disabling. Selecting both displays keeps both enabled.
- Turning the switch off enables automatic disabling and registers launch at login through `SMAppService.mainApp`. ScreenOff shows instructions if macOS requires approval. Turning the switch on unregisters this login item. Settings do not open automatically at login.
- Preferences from version 1.0.3 are preserved: the former automatic-off option being enabled corresponds to the current switch being off.
- Window positions are not restored when the built-in display returns.
- When display mirroring is enabled, ScreenOff asks you to turn it off in macOS settings before disabling the panel, preserving your mirroring configuration.

## Night Shift on external monitors

The settings window includes a switch for each connected external monitor model. Turn it on to exclude that model from macOS Night Shift and use the monitor’s own eye-care mode. Night Shift on the built-in screen continues to follow your macOS settings. The override also excludes the external model from True Tone.

Applying or restoring an exclusion asks for an administrator password and requires restarting the Mac. ScreenOff changes the `DisplayIsTV` field in a model-specific plist under `/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides`; identical monitors with the same vendor/product IDs share this setting. This is a persistent display-role override, rather than an instantaneous Night Shift control. Compatibility with a particular monitor and macOS version must be checked after restart; “Exclusion configured” reports the saved override, not a measurement of the screen’s color.

ScreenOff preserves existing override fields and saves the original role in a root-owned recovery record under `/Library/Application Support/ScreenOff/DisplayRoles`. Turn the switch off to restore the original role, including an originally absent setting. Restoration preserves unrelated changes made by other apps and remains available when the monitor is disconnected. If another app changes the role to a conflicting value, ScreenOff refuses to overwrite it.

Exclusions persist after quitting ScreenOff and do not require launch at login. **Restore exclusions and restart before uninstalling.** Removing the app alone does not remove these system settings or recovery records. Normal startup, preview mode and automated tests never apply an exclusion.

## Compatibility and recovery

Apple does not provide a public API for fully disabling an individual display. ScreenOff dynamically loads `SLSConfigureDisplayEnabled` / `CGSConfigureDisplayEnabled` and verifies the actual display state after changes. A macOS update can change this private API. If the required symbols are unavailable, ScreenOff opens but prevents disabling and explains why.

Disabling uses `forAppOnly`; enabling uses `forSession`. Neither permanently changes the configuration, but **exiting the process is not sufficient to undo the private disable** on the tested macOS build. An independent `ScreenOffWatchdog` remains responsible for recovery. The app and supervisor never perform a display-configuration call themselves: each change runs in a disposable child with a three-second timeout. A completed disable survives locking and sleep. Sleep cancels an in-flight child and retains rollback responsibility; lid closure requests recovery while the supervisor continues watching for reopening. No new transaction starts before the previous child exits.

A timed-out transaction waits for a real wake, lid, session or external-topology change before retrying, preventing a continuous CPU/retry loop. With a closed lid or sleeping displays, the supervisor sends no configuration commands. It retains the remembered built-in ID and recovery obligation until the panel is confirmed active with the lid open. These changes address the reported lock → close lid → unplug recovery path. The owner confirmed that the installed 1.3.2 fix resolved the reported wake failure; this follow-up is user-reported validation on the affected Mac. See [Verification](Docs/Verification.md).

Since version 1.0.3, ScreenOff handles macOS removing the built-in display from enumeration and creating a virtual placeholder. It excludes that placeholder from external monitors and can recover using the last positively identified built-in display ID. This fallback is allowed only for enabling, with the lid open and no usable external display; a newly discovered ID always takes priority. These are recovery mechanisms, not a guarantee against macOS failures.

To request manual recovery, even when the app is not running:

```sh
/Applications/ScreenOff.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenOff --recover
```

If the macOS API does not respond, close and open the lid or reconnect the monitor. If necessary, log out or restart the Mac.

## Building and testing

Install Xcode Command Line Tools; the full Xcode application is not required.

```sh
bash Scripts/test.sh       # Simulated recovery and real subprocess timeout checks
bash Scripts/build.sh      # dist/ScreenOff.app
bash Scripts/package.sh    # App, DMG, ZIP and SHA256SUMS.txt
```

Read-only display diagnostics:

```sh
dist/ScreenOff.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenOff --diagnose
```

An explicit hardware test with the lid open and an external monitor connected disables the built-in display for about two seconds, then restores it:

```sh
dist/ScreenOff.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenOff --hardware-test
```

Quit the ordinary ScreenOff instance before running hardware tests. Set `SIGNING_IDENTITY` to sign with a Developer ID certificate. Notarization requires your own Apple Developer account and is a separate step. `ARCH=x86_64` can build an Intel version, but Intel display disabling has not been validated and is not claimed as supported.

`bash Scripts/test-watchdog.sh` is a separate hardware test: it disables the display, closes the heartbeat channel and checks independent restoration while the parent remains alive. It also requires an external monitor and the ordinary ScreenOff instance to be closed.

`bash Scripts/test-interface.sh` checks background startup, absence of Dock and menu bar icons, window sizing and closing, focus-loss dismissal, and reopening the same process through LaunchServices (the Spotlight/Finder path). It uses isolated preview applications and does not control physical displays.

`bash Scripts/test-restore-only.sh` checks the real helper through a restore command, channel closure and restore-mode startup. The built-in display must already be enabled; this test sends no disable commands.

See [Architecture](Docs/Architecture.md) and [Verification](Docs/Verification.md) for details.

## Uninstalling

Restore any Night Shift exclusions and restart the Mac. Turn on “Use built-in display,” quit with the power button and delete ScreenOff.app. If you already deleted the app, remove its entry from macOS **Login Items**. No separate persistent services are installed. The display preference is stored in the `com.gevorg.screenoff` defaults domain.
